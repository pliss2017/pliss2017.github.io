            <a id="AlastairD" target="_blank" class="pn-name">Testing Programming Language Implementations</a> <a class="pn-aff-name"> by Alastair Donaldson </a>
            <p>Most modern software depends on reliable implementations of programming languages, through compilers, interpreters and virtual machines.  It's therefore important that programming language implementations are reliable, motivating techniques to validate them.  There has been a lot of exciting work recently on compiler verification and compiler testing.  In these lectures I will focus on the latter - methods for testing compilers to find defects early - which are readily applicable to rapidly evolving compiler code bases, such as the gcc and LLVM open source compiler projects.  I'll cover the major techniques that have been investigated in recent research literature: differential testing, equivalence modulo inputs testing (a form of metamorphic testing), and program enumeration, explaining what these are, what their associated benefits and drawbacks are, and how they complement each other.  I will finish by giving an overview of an ongoing project at Imperial, GLFuzz, which is a technique for testing compilers associated with OpenGL, the graphics API, focussing both on technical challenges and experiences from talking to GPU vendors who are interested in adopting this technique.  For an overview of GLFuzz check out <a href="https://medium.com/@afd_icl/crashes-hangs-and-crazy-images-by-adding-zero-689d15ce922b#.m2gxk5w95">this</a> series of Medium posts.</p>

            <a id="SteveB" target="_blank" class="pn-name"> Micro Virtual Machines </a> <a class="pn-aff-name"> by Steve Blackburn </a>
            <p>Many of today’s programming languages are broken. Poor performance, lack of features and hard-to-reason-about semantics can cost dearly in software maintenance and inefficient execution. The problem is only getting worse with programming languages proliferating and hardware becoming more complicated.
            An important reason for this brokenness is that much of language design is implementation-driven. The difficulties in implementation and insufficient understanding of concepts bake bad designs into the language itself. Concurrency, architectural details and garbage collection are three fundamental concerns that contribute much to the complexities of implementing managed languages.
            In this lecture I will describe the micro virtual machine, a thin abstraction designed specifically to relieve implementers of managed languages of the most fundamental implementation challenges that currently impede good design. The micro virtual machine targets abstractions over memory (garbage collection), architecture (compiler backend), and concurrency. I will motivate the micro virtual machine and give an account of the design and initial experience of a concrete instance, which we call Mu, built over a four year period. Our goal is to remove an important barrier to performant and semantically sound managed language design and implementation.</p>

            <p>The topics covered for this lecture range from the actor paradigm, integration of actors and objects to the concept of Causality – what it is, and what it buys for the programmer. I will also introduce the capabilities type system and show how capability types support safe sharing of mutable state. Finally, I will go into more details of formal type systems and syntax design philosophy with examples, live coding, and exercises. </p>

            <p>Whenever the need to compile a new dynamically typed language arises, an appealing option is to repurpose an existing statically typed language Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. This lecture will examine the benefits and limitations of the repurposed JIT approach. How far can JITs be stretched? </p>

            <a id="SureshJ" target="_blank" class="pn-name"> Reasoning about Weak Consistency and Isolation </a> <a class="pn-aff-name"> by Suresh Jagannathan </a>
            <p>Many real-world Web services --- such as those built and maintained by Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. --- replicate application state and logic across multiple replicas within and across data centers. Replication is intended not only to improve application throughput and reduce user-perceived latency, but also to tolerate partial failures without compromising overall service availability. Strong consistency models such as serializability, while easy to understand and specify, mask the realities underlying large-scale distributed systems with respect to non-uniform latency, availability, and network partitions.  Indeed, modern web services, which aim to provide an "always-on" experience, overwhelmingly favor availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency. To this end, several weak consistency models such as eventual consistency, causal consistency, session guarantees, and timeline consistency have been proposed and deployed in practice.
            While weakly consistent systems impose fewer demands on the operation of the underlying system, they complicate program reasoning by allowing concurrent conflicting updates and by exposing inconsistencies that may violate high-level program invariants.  In this lecture, we will study the semantics of such systems, and explore abstractions and formalisms that can be brought to bear to tame their complexity.  A concept closely related to weak consistency is weak isolation - a relaxation of serializability that allows transactions to witness evolving state as they execute.  Issues associated with reasoning about weak isolation bear similarity to those related to weak consistency.  We will also explore the relationship between these two notions, and the principles that can be brought to bear to simplify the way we understand weakly isolated behavior.

            <a id="RichardJ" target="_blank" class="pn-name"> Building High Performance, Fully Concurrent Garbage Collectors with Confidence </a> <a class="pn-aff-name"> by Richard E. Jones </a>
            <p>Building any kind of high performance garbage collector for a complete language implementation is hard. High performance requires careful attention to detail and bugs are notoriously difficult to discover. Add to the mix, copying and full concurrency (on-the-fly collection) makes the task even harder. In this talk, I'll explain how we built a high performance, replication copying, fully concurrent collector for Java, focusing in particular on how we obtained confidence that the collector was correct.</p>

            <p>In this lecture I will first give a gentle introduce to abstract interpretation, compare it with other formal methods, and explain why abstract interpretation is so successful in industry (spoiler alert: it focuses on the properties of interest and it scales up). I will then illustrate the applications of abstract interpretation at Facebook to analyze tens of millions of lines of code with a very false positive ratio.</p>

            <p>Encore is a new, open source, experimental object-oriented programming language developed in the UPSCALE EU project. Encore's starting point is the actor model with its inherent support for concurrent programming. Encore goes beyond the actor model, adding futures and active object-style asynchronous structured programming. 
            This lecture will focus on how Encore extends the actor model with so-called hot objects, and how that integration hits all parts of language design: surface syntax, type system, scheduling and garbage collection.</p>
